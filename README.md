Developed a comprehensive Windows Forms application that allows users to create, manipulate, and visualize various graphical shapes. This project demonstrates the application of core OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. The interface supports user interactions for shape creation, selection, movement, deletion, and parameter editing (e.g., resizing, changing colors, repositioning). Advanced features include:

-Class Hierarchy: Implemented an extensible class hierarchy for shapes, enabling easy addition of new shape types.
-Encapsulation and Access Control: Shapes encapsulate properties like coordinates and dimensions, with methods for calculating areas and drawing on the scene.
-Polymorphism: A unified collection in the scene class allows polymorphic operations on different shape types.
-Virtual Methods: Custom drawing, area calculation, and movement methods implemented through virtual and overridden functions.
-Delegates and Events: Integrated event-handling mechanisms for user interactions (e.g., OnClick events for shape editing).
-Undo/Redo Functionality: Command pattern employed to implement operation history, facilitating action reversal.

-Implemented a full-featured Windows Forms UI, including a visual scene for drawing and editing shapes, color customization, and file operations.
-Integrated System.Drawing for graphical visualization.
-Developed a modular command interface to add new shape operations without altering existing code.

-Data Persistence: Implemented file serialization for saving and loading the scene and shapes.
-LINQ Integration: Used LINQ for efficient management and querying of the shape collection.

Key Learnings: This project enhanced my understanding of OOP concepts, design patterns (Command Pattern), event-driven programming, and modular software design, preparing me for building maintainable and scalable applications.
